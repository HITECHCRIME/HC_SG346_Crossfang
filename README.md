## Lyrics

```
[intro echo lyrics]

(ooooo)
blade in her hands etchin' signs in my faith
taking what life gave before meeting death
i swear I'm done with this pray for me witch

[chorus]

blade in her hands etchin' signs in my faith
taking what life gave before meeting death
i swear I'm done with this pray for me witch
see me as I saw my corpse on the end                     /// on the bend

(eeeey yeeea)

[bridge]

circling dark vultures be ready to bury me
i'm teasing internal fake visions of hope                - teasin' n tellin'
certain's averted be ready to bury me

[verse 1]

i'm testing again with my visions at fault
see how i've fallen the prey to the soul
somewhat unseen i don't pray any better
i don't see the world at all                             /// I don't say it's worth at all

gasping at pain (ooooooh)
(oooooh nooooooo)
(WHISPER) all is in vain

[chorus]

blade in her hands etchin' signs in my faith
taking what life gave before meeting death
i swear i'm done with this pray for me witch
see me as i saw my corpse on the end

[verse 2]
make it or take it, it's such an ordeal
fallen from grace i can't pick it apart
i'm no longer able to tell you what's real 

[bridge out]
find me among wolves when sheep are asleep
preaching to choir what i truly believe
fill all my thoughts with fallacies, dream
to turn it around and finally feel 


---------------------------------------------------------------------


blade in her hands etchin' signs in my faith
taking what life gave before meeting death
i swear I'm done with this pray for me witch
see me as I saw my corpse on the end

circling dark vultures be ready to bury me
i'm teasing internal fake visions of hope
certain's averted be ready to bury me

i'm testing again with my visions at fault
see how I've fallen the prey to the soul
somewhat unseen I don't pray any better
i don't say it's worth at all

Ready to go

Pay up your duty dark, circle ops already rounded the rot
From dense smoke and the mirrors comes target is locked 
and fact that we still have control (true true)

These rotten inscriptions are prepped and they ready to glow
I keep that promise when Bodies are twisted, ritual is vested 
Bad entities gone

Welcome comptetent, feel the contingency, it's the purge of the thoughts
It's a means of escape, hatred put to a stop


, it's about to blast


chant 
got a drip drip drip on a thicc witch  
full lock - rage is taking all the reigns bitch
body is a stock, twitch twitch twitch
venom pushin out the corpse
succubus fangs on the cross 
with the neck get these hands outta the way
stretch it your wretched i'll suck on your face
